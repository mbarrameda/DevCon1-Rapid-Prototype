# DevCon1-Rapid-Prototype
 Our GDD for our DevCon

Desired Game Mechanic - We are developing a 2D Platformer with a gravity flip mechanic. The player will have to solve puzzles and challenges by flipping gravity, allowing them to walk on walls, ceilings, and floors. This gravity flip will be a core part of the level traversal and puzzle-solving.

Objective - Our objective for this is to create a 2D platformer where players can manipulate gravity in a four-dimensional room. By flipping gravity, the player can alter their environment and path in real time, walking along walls and ceilings to solve puzzles and reach new areas.

How exactly does the ability to manipulate gravity in different directions change the way the player solves puzzles and navigate in a 2D setting?

Design Rationale - We want the player to feel challenged, empowered, and disoriented but satisfied! The puzzles need to be carefully thought out, making solving them feel rewarding! The player will also have control over gravity giving them a more unique movement option will create a sense of freedom when the player navigates the levels. Last but definitely not the least, the flip mechanic will create a sense of confusion as the player will have to learn how to master it, however, they will feel a sense of satisfaction when they solve puzzles.

Our game is definitely on the more innovative side of things because it showcases a 4-way gravity flip mechanic that is different than your traditional movement in platformers. The players can move not only left and right but also up and down which will create a more dynamic environment!
